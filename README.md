This repository contains a Jupiter notebook which describes how to use basic machine learning tools such Scikit-Learning, Pandas, and Numpy for buiding models.

The Jupiter notebooks describe how to do:

1. Loading and cleaning data
2. Build several models
3. Pick the best model based on K-Fold cross validation.
4. Run the model against the testing dataset.
5. Finally, conclusions and future directions.
